# Self Driving Car NanoDegree by Udacity

This repository contains code and writeups for projects and labs completed as a part of UDACITY's first of it's kind self driving car nanodegree program.

The program is 9 months long and has three terms in total with individual terms focussing on:

1. Computer Vision and Deep Learning - *Completed*

2. Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control - *Completed*

3. Path Planning and System Integration - *Completed*

Each of terms has comprehensive projects to ensure percolation of presented concepts. The repository is organized according to individual terms and corresponding projects/labs are contained within the subdirectories.

The course completion certificate can be found [here](https://confirm.udacity.com/JWQSTDYL).
